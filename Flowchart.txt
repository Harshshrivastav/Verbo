>>>>>>
Step 1: Environment Setup
>>>>>>

    Create Project Directory:>>>
    Organize your project in a dedicated directory:
    mkdir 1-Project-TranslatorApp
    cd 1-Project-TranslatorApp

    Set Up Virtual Environment:>>>
    Create a new virtual environment using conda or venv:
    conda create venv -p python=3.12
    conda activate ./venv

    Install Dependencies:>>>
    Create a requirements.txt file and install the dependencies:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    Setup Environment Variables:>>>
    Create an .env file to store API keys:
    GROQ_API_KEY = "******************abcxyz123"
    

>>>>>>
Step 2: (version-1) Build the Authentication System
>>>>>>
    Create Authentication Module(auth.py):
        Implement login and registration logic using streamlit-authenticator.
    Integration(with app.py):
        Ensure the authentication is integrated smoothly with other features.
    Prerequisites:

>>>>>>>
Step 5: Deployment
>>>>>>>
    Deploy the server:
    Deploy the serve.py file on onrender
    Deploy to Streamlit:
    Push your code to a GitHub repository.


>>>>>>>>>
Step 6: Testing and Maintenance
>>>>>>>>>
    Test the application:
    Test the application thoroughly to ensure it works as expected.
    Fix bugs and improve performance:
    Continuously monitor and improve the application to ensure it remains stable and efficient.
